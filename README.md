# AbilityGrowthRedistribution
A NetLogo Model showing two surprisng effects how redistribution can spur growth.

This model runs in NetLogo 6.2.2 which is freely available at https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/

There is a NetLogoWeb version which runs in the browser under this link 
https://www.netlogoweb.org/launch#https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janlorenz/AbilityGrowthRedistribution/master/AbilityGrowthRedistribution_NetLogoWeb.nlogo
The original version does not run in NetLogoWeb because it uses the `no-display` primitive to increase speed in the "go 5000 ticks fast" button. 
This primitive is not available in NetLogoWeb. Anyway, NetLogoWeb is slower than the desktop version.
